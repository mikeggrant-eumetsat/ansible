# This is a regression test for issue-81741
# A success or failure to change the hostname isn't a regression.
# It only matters if the hostname was intepreted as a flag.
# 
# it can succeed (maybe changing the hostname to something weird) => pass (not interpreted as flag)
#  - in this case, there will be no command_result.msg variable
#
# It can fail with an invalid option warning => fail (interpreted as flag)
# It can fail (or partially fail) with a warning dashes are bad characters => pass (not interpreted as flag)
#  - in both cases above, the warning will be in the command_result.msg variable
#
# a rescue block is used to catch the "fails" and examine the msg for errors indicating flag interpretation
